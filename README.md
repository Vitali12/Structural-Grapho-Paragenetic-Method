Materials for the article "Structural-Grapho-Paragenetic Method for Assessment of Fracturing and Paleostresses Based on Lineament Analysis and a Digital Model of Rock Exposures. Examples from the Southeastern Fennoscandian Shield"

This directory consist of the main materials to illustrate the content of the article. 
Besides of the pictures of high resolution we putted the initial data which were used in the article to provide possibilities to check all our calculations.

For our work we used GIS technology based on QGIS 3.18, and SAGA 7.8.2. and Tveite H., 2015. The QGIS Line Direction Histogram Plugin. http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/LineDirectionHistogram/ as well.

All calcuations with digital outcrop models were done with the use of the CloudCompare (CC) program (https://www.danielgm.net/cc/). To identify flat structures (fractures), the specialized plug-ins, qFacet and qCompass, which are the part of the CC package.

Any of abowe mentioned programs and technologies (like a drain channels extraction) are very well described in the form of video and text manuals in the Internet (Youtube.com, for example).
